If you're looking for the version of the Peachy Printer that we were gearing up to manufacture, look at mini-v1.14. 

If you're wondering what v1.15 is all about, it's a work-in-progress that we started because of a huge panic: right around the time we were getting ready for our final test manufacturing run, the STM32F042 practically vanished from the entire supply chain! We couldn't find them anywhere! So I quickly started redoing the board to use an STM32F070 instead, but in the end the supply chain recovered before we had to pull the trigger on the respin.
